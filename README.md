# 3D Cartoon Sticker Generator

## Project Overview

**Objective**: Develop a system that converts real images into 3D cartoon stickers using thematic prompts for customization.

**Target Audience**:
- Digital Artists: Seeking unique tools to enhance their work.
- Social Media Users: Looking for customizable stickers to personalize their online presence.

## Project Scope

- **Image-to-Image Translation**: Convert real images into cartoon-style images.
- **3D Model Creation**: Transform 2D cartoon images into 3D stickers.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Allow users to generate stickers based on thematic prompts.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**:
  - PyTorch (Primary)
  - TensorFlow (Alternative)
- **Pre-trained Models**:
  - GPT: For generating prompt embeddings (via Hugging Face Transformers).
  - ResNet: For feature extraction from images (via Torchvision).
- **3D Modeling Software**: Blender
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV
- **GPU Acceleration**: CUDA (Optional)
- **Web Frameworks**:
  - Flask or Django: For building the web application.
- **Deployment Platforms**:
  - Heroku or AWS

## Project Flow

1. **Project Scope Definition**: Define the projectâ€™s goals and target audience.
2. **Data Collection**: Collect real images and their cartoon-style versions. Consider AnimeCeleb Dataset.
3. **Technology Stack Selection**: Choose the tools and frameworks to support your project.
4. **Develop Image-to-Image Translation Model**: Use GANs to map real images to cartoon-style images. Train the GAN on the dataset using PyTorch, leveraging GPU resources for efficiency.
5. **Implement Prompt Engineering**: Convert thematic prompts into embeddings using GPT. Extract features from images using ResNet. Combine prompt embeddings with image features. Train the entire system end-to-end.
6. **Create 3D Models**: Use Blender to apply 2D cartoon images as textures on 3D models. Sculpt or create 3D shapes that align with the cartoon design.
7. **Post-Processing**: Use Blender for rendering, smoothing edges, and adding visual effects like shadows and highlights.
8. **Testing and Evaluation**: Collect user feedback through tools like Google Forms. Refine the model based on user input.
9. **Deployment**: Develop a web application where users can upload images and enter prompts. Deploy on Heroku or AWS.

## Sample Thematic Prompts

- **Cute Animals**: Adorable cartoon stickers of puppies, kittens, pandas, etc.
- **Food and Drinks**: Cartoon stickers of burgers, pizza, ice cream, etc.
- **Festivals and Holidays**: Festive stickers for Christmas, Halloween, etc.
- **Kawaii and Chibi**: Adorable, stylized cartoon stickers in popular art styles.
